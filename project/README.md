# POKEDEX
    #### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
    #### Description: This is a small application which creates and uses a small pokedex (txt) file which keeps track of your pokemon and states its abilities. It uses PokeApi to retrieve the pokemon information, using file I/O, adds pokemon and their ability and types with stylization, and reads using non whitespace started text to list pokemon from it. Also has error checks which prevent redundant or wrong inputs. Requires response package and is formatted well enough to be cleaned if required
